<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>Welcome to my Portfolio.</p>
<p>Hi. I am a Master's student in Computer Graphics and Game Technology (CGGT) at University of Pennsylvania.<br> My love for animated movies led me to pursue this course. I am from India, where I pursued my undergraduate degree in Computer Science. <br> Other than graphics, I love photography, exploring new places, watching tv series and playing tennis! </p>
